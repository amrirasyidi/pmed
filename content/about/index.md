The entries in this blog is dedicated to record my personal experience going through this mortal world.

Sometimes it is just basic day to day life experience. Sometimes I may write something I that Iâ€™m working on.

This blog is also my attempt to convince you that Iâ€™m a f*cking professional (data science expert btw) and also share my totally biased personal opinions. Because who doesnâ€™t want unsolicited advice from someone who spends most of their day staring at Excel sheets? ðŸ—¿

Youâ€™ll also get a glimpse into my personal life, which is basically just me trying to balance work, social life (which I donâ€™t have), and a healthy dose rant.
