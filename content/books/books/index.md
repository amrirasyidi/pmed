Below are some books that I've read, sorted based on when I start reading it, roughly. From the latest to the oldest. Can you guess on what basis do I sort the grouping?

This list only include non-fiction books, because I rarely read a fiction and only don't quite remember what I've read. Maybe later, I'll only include the books that are memorable for me, or something I can recommend.

**Symbol meaning**

- 🚀: provoke curiosity<br>
I want to write "recommended", but somehow that word doesn't really fit of what I'm trying to say.
- ⚖️: balancer<br>
I like to be a moderate, I like to challange my own belief. That's why, sometimes I intentionally look for a critique or the opposite idea of what I've just read.
