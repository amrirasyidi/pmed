1. This post (and the whole Unemployment Arc series) should have been written and posted when I was still unemployed, as a continuation from the previous post. Hence, this post—should—reflect what I thought at that time, however insights from the current situation is inevitable.
1. This is not a badmouthing by any mean. Hopefully my words reflect it lol.

# Why Gojek is so good

I’ll break the Aladeen things first, I will break the Aladeen things later.

## Manager, Team, and Culture

After ~2 years of experience of working, you will hear at least one of the following complaints:

_“Manager gua bisanya nyuruh doang” or “Manager gua galaknya ga manusiawi”_

_“Gua lembur lagi kemaren malem”_

_“Setau gua dari segi gaji, ini cukup pelit sih wkwk”_

I hear that, many times from the internet, a few times from my friends in different company, and once or twice from fellow go troops from different teams. And of course there are many other complaints living in this capitalist setting.

Gojek and Fraud/Risk team for me were different. I had a really good time while working there. I am confident enough to say, Gojek is one of the best place to work (especially to start) in the tech/start-up industry. This, I think, can be condensed into 3 reasons:
1. The managers<br>
“Good employees leave bad managers” Or so they say. Though not always true (manager is not the only reason for an employee to leave), managers can really be the make or break for this kind of decision. And in Gojek’s case, I believe my direct manager played a role on keeping me for a longer period. As a context, the thought of leaving started by the end of my first year at Gojek. But I finally leave only after ~2.5 years working there, moreover, I left after my direct manager transferred to another team. Between that thought of leaving and the execution, she did things, small and big, that made me think that I still can learn many things here, facilitated and supported, hence, leaving now will only throw away those opportunities. Many of those “things” I think revolve around her decisions and reactions towards other “things”. Yes, this is very abstract, but to sum it up, in my opinion, the decisions and reactions were rational and humane. One more important thing, she did not micro-manage, lol.
1. The team<br>
One thing I want to highlight here is that, we are within the same age (and same phase in life). This leads to similar interest and topic to talk about, similar type of activity, and no “unnecessary” generational respect needed (why does this sound bad? lol).
1. The culture<br>
Back to my first day at Gojek, I decided that my priority here is to learn as much as possible. Lucky enough, Gojek (and my team and its nature of the job) facilitates this. Not only providing the platform, but also the time. There were many learning opportunities such as learning from a course to project based learning.
In retrospect, many of the learning process I did there was actually “sub-optimal” or to put it lightly, “can be better”. But at that time, it was good enough for me.
Another notable “culture” I can think of is “inclusivity” (I don’t fancy this word). This add to certain degree the sense of project ownership, being acknowledged, and respected. About the “respected” I can say with confidence that this is differ from team to team, hahaha.

And for some people, maybe there’s one more, salary/benefit. But I didn’t really think about this back then. I was working just barely above the minimum living wage when I started, and I felt just okay.

**Well then, why did I finally left Gojek? Can you guess?**

# Why Gojek is not so good (for me)

## Expectation ≠ Reality

If I remember correctly, first time I applied for this position, the role was “Ops Analyst”. There’s the word “analyst” in it, which made me assume, the position will do many deep analysis, creating report and dashboards, stuffs like that. But boy I was wrong.

Turns out, the spectrum of “analyst” in the industry spread very widely.

But I also know, this is partly on me. I didn’t do much research. I was a fresh grad, I need to put some on my plate, I got excited over learning python, and it was Gojek. I didn’t think twice to apply. (To be fair, the take home test assignment is somewhat challenging for me that time, sadly, the test didn’t reflect the day-to-day job).

Gojek and Fraud/Risk team were a really great company and team in my perspective.

Even though, it was not my main responsibility to do those analysis and dashboarding, still I was given flexibility to do what I want, with that also came the bandwidth relief of my core task while doing those side quests, plus being recognized for doing an extra-mile. That said, my expectation about being an “analyst” still come and go every now and then during my first 2 years in Gojek. After all, those more exciting task were not the main quests. Those were side quests.

    </blockquote>

This one is still related to the expectation thingy.

The nature of my job, especially back then, is repetitive, therefore doesn’t require much of thinking process. On one side, this is a good thing because I can finish the job quickly, then do some other thing, or I can just relax. On the flip side, the job itself offer little to none growth prospective. I kept thinking, “doing ‘just’ this in the coming years, is a bad sign”.

Then I tried internal transfer to several positions that catch my interest. Usually, I have no problem on doing the technical take home test, but as I got to the interview rounds, I perform rather poorly.

Again, my priority on my early career (which I still hold to this day) is learning and personal/professional growth. Meaning, I would like to have some tangible growth, for example:

1. I can’t implement a machine learning algorithm to solve certain problem, in 6 months, I want to be able to solve that problem by implementing a machine learning algorithm.
1. I don’t know how to push my solution into production, in 2 weeks, I want to be able to push it to production by myself (or at least with minimum supervision).
1. I have never lead a project before, I want to be able to deliver a project with certain standards in 1 year.

Things like that.

The more I’m thinking about this priority, or value to make it fancier, the more I realized that the most effective way for me is to learning by doing, a project based learning.

<div class="columns">
  <div class="column" style="flex-basis: 50%; padding: 0px;">
      <p>I still think that I have some potential to be utilized better. I am eager to learn. And I think I have the time. But I was not as creative to make my own project.
      <br><br>However, those poorly performed interviews round, made me realized, the expectation to be met to be able to fill in those position were out of my reach.</p>

Do you know how itchy it feels to think that you want to move already, but you don’t know how and where to? I felt that I can do much more than just this, but at the same time, it felt like I didn’t have what it takes yet to do those more challenging task, but how can I ever be ready if I never get challenged?

This puts me in an awkward position. I want to move forward, but the next step is to steep for me to take.


<p style="color:red;font-size:24px;text-align:center"><b>I was hardstuck…</b></p>

And do you know what is a reasonable solution for this situation?

Back off, relax, and evaluate.

And that what I did exactly, I just didn’t do it correctly the first time.

# At last
My “itchy-ness” peaks, an opportunity was just around the corner. This leads me to think “at this point, anything will be better than status quo”. Then, I compromised my own ideal, from “I want to be a data scientist” to “better move first than not at all”.

This is not a good thing, this is what I mean by “I just didn’t do it correctly the first time.”

In retrospect, my first career switching was premature. My next job (condition) at Zenius was even worse. I never satisfied with what I did. I constantly questioning myself, “am I retarded?”. I want to say that I got impostor syndrome, but I don’t think I am that good to have an impostor syndrome. LOL.

This maybe was the price of compromising my own ideal.
